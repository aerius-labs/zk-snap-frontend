# ZkSnap: Verifiable on/off chain DAO voting with ballot privacy using storage proofs

## Introduction
**ZkSnap** is an innovative solution that revolutionizes the way DAO voting is conducted.

Traditional voting systems often expose participants to the bandwagon effect, surveillance, and coercion, compromising the integrity of the decision-making process. ZkSnap changes the game by employing zk proofs, which allow individuals to cast their votes securely and anonymously. Your voting preferences remain confidential, safeguarding your autonomy and protecting against any external influence.

Our unique integration of storage proofs guarantees the transparency and accuracy of the voting power of individuals. By leveraging storage proofs, we are able to verify the integrity of the voting individual and the exact voting power that they hold.

**This repo consists of the frontend interface for ZkSnap.**

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
